### Build Instructions
Staff Helper Bot is made using C# and .net core 3.1. To create and run a build of the bot, you'll need to install .net core 3.1.

Confirm that your installation of .net core is functioning by typing `dotnet` in your cmd/terminal.

Once installed, create a clone of this repo and navigate to that directory in windows cmd or other OS terminal. Specifically the folder named `IPL-StaffHelperBot`, it contains .cs files in it. From here, type `dotnet run` and the bot should compile and boot up asking for a token. Paste the bot token then the bot will be online.
